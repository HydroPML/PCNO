## 2D Real-world flood forecasting
The surrogate models (PCNO and DiffPCNO) are designed for large-scale, cross-regional, and downscaled flood forecasting.  We use FloodCastBench to evaluate surrogate models. The dataset comprises four large-scale
floods: Pakistan flood, Mozambique flood, Australia flood, and UK flood. To assess the effectiveness and transferability of these models, we define two scenarios: low-fidelity forecasting
using the Pakistan and Mozambique flood datasets (480 m spatial, 5 min temporal resolution) and high-fidelity forecasting using the Australia and UK flood datasets (60 m or 30 m spatial, 5 min temporal resolution).
